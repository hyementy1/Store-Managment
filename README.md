# Unit 2 - Store Management Project

## Introduction

You are opening a new business in your community! Businesses often need programs to manage the products and services they offer and track orders and requests from customers. Your goal is to create a store management system for your business.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming and class structure and design to create your store management system:
- **Create a class hierarchy** – Develop a superclass that represents a product or service your business offers and one or more subclasses that extend the superclass to represent more specific types of products or services.
- **Declare instance variables** – Declare instance variables in the superclass that are shared with the subclasses and instance variables in the subclasses that are not shared with the superclass.
- **Write constructors** – Write no-argument and parameterized constructors in the superclass and subclasses. Subclass constructors use the super keyword to call the superclass constructor.
- **Implement accessor and mutator methods** – Write accessor and mutator methods for instance variables that should be accessible and/or modifiable from outside of the class.
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write toString() methods in the superclass and subclasses that return information about the state of an object.

## Description

Write a description of your project here. Include what your store you made, and why you chose this topic. In your description, include as many vocab words from our class to explain how you represented the item/service from your store. If you have user input, explain how the user will interact with your store such as which questions are prompted to the user, what response is your program expecting, and how that is used to output information for your store in the console.

For my project, I created a grocery store because I wanted to organize different types of food items using object-oriented programming. I made a superclass called GroceryItem that holds common attributes like name, price, and taxable, and I also included two subclasses produce and packagedFood which add instance variables such as freshness or if the product needs to be frozen. My program uses inheritance, constructors, and methods to show how these classes are connected. It also includes user input where the customer can choose the type of item by entering its name where they will then get the following attributes of the item like it's price, if its taxable, or if it needs to be frozen.
